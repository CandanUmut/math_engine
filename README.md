# PRU Math Engine

A learning, auditable, relational math reasoner. Not a math solver — a layer
**above** SymPy / numerical tools / Z3 that decides which tool to call, which
approach to try, and which sequence of steps to use; learns from every
problem it solves; and exposes every decision as an inspectable graph.

The thesis is the Precomputed Relational Universe (PRU) model: knowledge is
most efficiently represented as a graph of precomputed relations between
entities, so solving a new problem is a traversal over that graph rather than
a from-scratch computation. Applied to math, every problem, every tool call,
every success and failure becomes a node or edge — and new problems are
solved by retrieving similar past problems, replaying what worked, adapting,
and updating the graph.

See `PHILOSOPHY.md` for the longer version, and `SCHEMA.md` for the data model.

## Status

The five planned phases plus operational hardening (Phase 6) are
feature-complete. **Phase 7** closed the loop between the hypothesizer
and the learner: verified rules now influence future ranking, identity
chaining proposes new identities from existing ones, and "hard"
signature classes get flagged with their working fallback.

The Phase 5 success criterion — "the system has proposed and verified at
least one identity or shortcut that was not explicitly given to it" —
is met: with no special priming, solving `sin(x)**2 + cos(x)**2` and
`1` produces the verified hypothesis `sin(x)**2 + cos(x)**2 ≡ 1`,
proven by SymPy, and a corresponding `rule` node appears in the graph
with `uses_rule` edges back to the supporting problems.

### What Phase 1 does

- Parse a math problem in one of three formats:
  - **SymPy syntax** — `x**2 + 3*x - 4`, `Eq(x**2 - 5*x + 6, 0)`, `Integral(x**2, (x, 0, 1))`
  - **LaTeX** — `\int_{0}^{1} x^2 dx`, `\sin(x)^2 + \cos(x)^2`
  - **Natural language** — via a local Ollama model (optional; disabled if Ollama isn't running)
- Compute a deterministic structural **fingerprint** for the problem.
- Dispatch to the right SymPy routine based on problem type
  (`solve`, `integrate`, `differentiate`, `simplify`, `factor`, `expand`, `evaluate`, `limit`, `series`).
- **Verify** the answer numerically (sampling) or symbolically (back-substitution, derivative check, quadrature).
- **Persist** the problem, the attempt, the fingerprint, and the verification status to SQLite.
- Expose a FastAPI backend and a minimal dark-mode web UI that shows the answer, the reasoning trace, and the fingerprint.

### What Phase 2 adds

- A persistent **NetworkX MultiDiGraph** of typed nodes (problems, tools, problem-types, signature clusters, rules) and typed edges (`solved_by`, `has_type`, `has_signature`, `similar_to`, `uses_rule`). Atomic gpickle save on every solve; corrupt files are quarantined and a fresh graph is created.
- A **retrieval** layer (`pru_math.retrieval`) that joins the graph (fingerprints) with the SQLite store (solutions and verification status) and returns the top-K most structurally similar past problems. A scipy-sparse path is included for graphs past ~200 nodes; below that, the simple Python scan is faster.
- The reasoner now queries the graph **before** calling SymPy and surfaces the neighbours in the response and the trace. Per the Phase 2 spec, **decisions are not yet routed on the graph** — Phase 3 introduces that. Phase 2 just exposes the relations.
- A four-tab UI:
  - **Solve** — input, answer, similar-past-problems panel, full reasoning trace, fingerprint.
  - **Graph** — interactive Cytoscape view of the relational graph; toggle similar / type / tool / signature edges; click any node or edge for details.
  - **Database** — sortable, filterable raw inspectors for `problems`, `attempts`, and `tool_outcomes`. The "see the database" requirement.
  - **Insights** — per-problem-type counts, per-tool/approach verify rates, per-source-format mix.
- New endpoints: `GET /graph`, `GET /graph/around/{id}`, `GET /graph/stats`, `GET /problems/{id}/similar`, `GET /attempts`, `GET /tool_outcomes`, `GET /config`.

### What Phase 3 adds (backend complete)

- **`pru_math/learner.py`** — UCB1 ranker over per-`(signature, tool, approach)` statistics from `tool_outcomes`. Falls back to type-level aggregates joined via `problems.signature` when a fingerprint is brand new, plus a neutral prior + max bonus when neither level has data. Fully read-only; no separate model state.
- **`pru_math/tools/sympy_tool.py`** — restructured into a registry of named approaches per problem type (`sympy.solve`/`sympy.solveset`/`sympy.roots` for SOLVE, `sympy.integrate`/`sympy.integrate.meijerg`/`sympy.integrate.risch` for INTEGRATE, four flavours of simplify, etc.). Approach names are stable strings written to `attempts.approach` and `tool_outcomes.approach` so the learner can key statistics on them.
- **Reasoner multi-attempt loop**: parse → fingerprint → retrieval → rank candidates → try (≤`PRU_MAX_ATTEMPTS`, default 3) → verify → persist all attempts → graph_update → emit trace. Stops early on the first verified result.
- **Failure-mode tracking** — `tool_outcomes.failure_modes_json` records up to the last 8 distinct error tags per `(signature, tool, approach)`; populated automatically on every refuted/inconclusive/error attempt.
- **New endpoints**: `GET /learner/rank?problem_type=...&signature=...` previews the live ranker; `GET /attempts/timeline` feeds the dashboard.
- **Demonstrable learning**: solving five quadratics from a fresh DB, the engine picks `sympy.roots` for the first three (greedy), then UCB1's exploration bonus pulls `sympy.solve` ahead and tries it. Both verified.

### What Phase 4 adds (backend complete)

- **Tool registry** (`pru_math/tools/registry.py`). Every backend implements the new `Tool` ABC: `is_available()`, `candidate_approaches(problem_type)`, `can_handle(fingerprint) -> confidence`, `solve_with(problem, approach) -> ToolResult`, plus optional `cross_verify(problem, candidate)`. The reasoner asks the registry for *all* candidate `(tool, approach)` pairs; the learner ranks across the union, not just within SymPy.
- **`pru_math/tools/numeric_tool.py`** — scipy/mpmath-backed approaches: `numeric.fsolve` and `numeric.brentq` for transcendental / high-degree roots, `numeric.quad` for definite integrals, `numeric.evalf` for closed-form numerical values.
- **`pru_math/tools/z3_tool.py`** — Z3 SMT for SOLVE (real and integer domains) and PROVE (assert ¬claim, expect unsat). Translates the polynomial / rational / inequality subset of SymPy expressions; raises `Z3UnsupportedError` on transcendentals so the reasoner skips it cleanly. Implements a domain-specific `cross_verify` for SOLVE problems that substitutes each candidate root and asks Z3 to prove the residual is zero.
- **`pru_math/tools/wolfram_tool.py`** — optional HTTP backend. `is_available()` returns `False` when `WOLFRAM_APP_ID` is unset and the registry filters the tool out — no network calls are ever made without a key.
- **Cross-verification** — when `PRU_CROSS_VERIFY=true`, a verified primary result is re-checked by a *different* tool (numeric vs. SymPy, Z3 vs. SymPy, ...). The outcome (`agree` / `disagree` / `inconclusive` / `unsupported`) is persisted as new `cross_verify_*` columns on the `attempts` row and surfaced in the trace and the `attempts` API. Schema is auto-migrated on existing databases.
- **Self-confidence as tiebreak**: each tool's `can_handle(fingerprint)` returns a confidence in `[0, 1]`. The registry sorts candidates by confidence; the learner uses original input order as a deterministic tiebreaker so a cold-start problem prefers the high-confidence tool's approach.
- **`GET /tools`** lists every registered tool with its availability and class name.
- **End-to-end**: with the default registry (SymPy + numeric + Z3, Wolfram unavailable), `Integral(x**2, (x, 0, 1))` is solved by SymPy and cross-verified `agree` by numeric quadrature; quadratics are solved by `sympy.roots` and cross-verified by either numeric or Z3 depending on which is picked first.

### What Phase 9 adds

The hypothesizer's verified identities are no longer just ranking
hints — they're now usable as **rewriting rules** during solving.
This is the deepest claim of the project made tangible: the engine
gets smarter without retraining a single weight.

- **`pru_math/rewriter.py`** turns verified `identity` hypotheses into `RewriteRule` objects. Each rule's LHS is rendered as a SymPy `Wild`-based pattern so `sin(x)**2 + cos(x)**2 ≡ 1` matches `sin(y)**2 + cos(y)**2` without per-variable configuration. Both directions are considered, but a direction is dropped when the target side has free symbols the source can't bind (so `1 → sin(x)**2 + cos(x)**2` is correctly skipped).
- **Pattern matching is two-stage**: a direct `expr.replace(pattern, template)` first, and — when the pattern is an `Add` — a sub-Add subset match using a `Wild('_rest')` so `sin(z)**2 + cos(z)**2 - 1` is matched as `pattern + (-1)` and rewritten to `1 + (-1) = 0`. This catches the case SymPy's plain `replace` misses (an `Add` of three terms doesn't structurally contain a sub-Add of two).
- **Post-failure phase in the reasoner**: rewriting fires *only* when the primary multi-attempt loop fails to produce a verified result. The existing flow is untouched. Each rewrite generates a fresh `ParsedProblem` and runs through the same `registry.solve_with` toolchain. **Verification still runs against the *original* problem**, so the engine never claims `x is the answer to A` when it actually solved `B` — the audit story stays clean.
- **New trace step kind**: `rewrite`. The trace shows the rule id, direction, the LHS → RHS strings, and the rewritten expression. The matching `tool_call` step carries `rewrite_via_rule` metadata. Persisted attempts on rewrites include a `(rewrite via rule #N)` step entry so they're identifiable in `attempts.steps_json`.
- **Settable**: `enable_rewriting` (default `true`) and `max_rewrite_attempts` (default `2`) are both runtime-settable from the cog menu, so users can switch the phase off entirely or tighten the budget.

### What Phase 8 adds

Turns the engine from "a calculator that learns" into something a researcher can use as a working notebook.

- **Sessions** — a small `sessions` table (id / title / notes_markdown / timestamps) plus a nullable `session_id` column on `problems` (auto-migrated). Group related problems together with free-form markdown notes; problems linked to a deleted session keep their data with `session_id=NULL`. Existing solves stay valid.
- **Endpoints**: `GET /sessions`, `POST /sessions`, `GET /sessions/{id}` (returns the session plus its problem list in solve order), `PUT /sessions/{id}`, `DELETE /sessions/{id}`, `POST /problems/{id}/session` (attach / detach). `POST /solve` now accepts an optional `session_id`.
- **`POST /explain/{problem_id}`** — Ollama narrator. Reads the existing solved record (problem, attempts, verification, cross-verify), builds a strictly-constrained prompt that forbids the model from solving anything, and returns a 2–5 sentence plain-English narration. Falls back to a deterministic English summary built from the trace when `OLLAMA_ENABLED=false` or the local model is unreachable, so the endpoint always returns something useful.
- **Sessions panel** on the Solve tab: dropdown to pick a session, "new" / "rename" / "delete" controls, an editable markdown notes area that persists on save. Solves with an active session attach automatically.
- **"Explain in plain English"** button next to the answer; the narration appears below with a small `source: ollama|deterministic` tag so users always know whether they're reading machine-paraphrased English or a deterministic template.
- `/db/stats` now reports a `sessions: <count>` field.

The hard constraint stays in force: **the LLM never decides math.** Every fact in the narration comes from the engine's own records; the model only paraphrases.

### What Phase 7 adds

The hypothesizer's discoveries no longer sit passively in the graph —
they influence the next solve.

- **Identity-aware ranking** (`pru_math/rules.py`). The Learner now optionally takes a `RelationalGraph` reference. On every rank, it walks the graph from the current problem's signature node out to any verified `rule` nodes (`r:hyp_*`) and counts how many `(tool, approach)` witnesses each candidate has on supporting problems. Each witness adds a small bonus (`PRU_LEARNER_RULE_BONUS=0.05`, capped at `0.30`) on top of the UCB score, surfaced as `rule_bonus` and `rule_witnesses` in `CandidateStats` and the `decision` trace step's rationale. Verification rate stays the dominant term — rules just nudge the engine toward approaches that have been part of an identity chain on similar problems.
- **Transitive identity detector** (`Hypothesizer.detect_transitive_identities`). For every pair of verified `A ≡ B` and `B ≡ C` whose canonical bridge form lines up, the engine proposes `A ≡ C` and runs it through the same SymPy / numeric / Z3 verifier. Carries `derived_from: [parent_id_1, parent_id_2]` in its evidence so the chain is auditable.
- **Hard-signature detector** (`Hypothesizer.detect_hard_signatures`). For each signature class with at least 3 verified problems and an average `> 1.5` attempts-until-verified, propose a "fallback chain" hypothesis recording the most-frequently-winning `(tool, approach)`. Reuses the recurring-approach kind so the existing stat-verifier handles it. This makes "this signature is harder than usual; here's what works" a first-class output of the engine.
- **Auto-merge of derived hypotheses**: every detector goes through the same `upsert_hypothesis` path keyed on the deterministic fingerprint, so re-scans (including the auto-scan loop) merge new evidence into existing rows without duplicating.

### What Phase 6 adds

- **Tool-call timeout enforcement** — `CONFIG.tool_timeout_s` was read but never applied; now every `Tool.solve_with` is wrapped in a `concurrent.futures` budget. A timeout becomes an ordinary failed `ToolResult` with `error="ToolTimeoutError: ..."`, so the learner records it as a normal failure mode and moves on to the next candidate. Per-tool `timeout_s` overrides are supported.
- **Cross-verifier priority** — Z3 (proof) outranks numeric (empirical agreement) outranks SymPy (symbolic re-derivation). The `pick_cross_verifier` returns the highest-priority eligible tool deterministically, so `Z3` is preferred whenever it can handle the problem.
- **Runtime settings** (`pru_math/settings.py`). Layered on top of frozen `CONFIG` so a `PUT /config` flip takes effect immediately and persists to `data/settings.json` without restarting. The validator is the single source of truth for ranges and types. New endpoints: `GET /config` (now also lists `settable_keys`), `PUT /config`, `POST /config/reset`. The UI gains a cog icon that opens a settings modal.
- **Database export / import** (`pru_math/exporter.py`). `GET /db/export` returns a single JSON bundle of every persisted row plus a base64-encoded gpickle of the graph; `POST /db/import` replaces the live state atomically (single SQL transaction) and rejects malformed bundles. The Database tab gains export and import buttons. The user's accumulated knowledge is now portable.
- **Auto-scan**. With `auto_scan_every_n > 0`, the reasoner triggers `Hypothesizer.scan(verify=True)` in-process every N solves. The result lands in the trace as an `auto_scan` step listing what was discovered. Set `PRU_AUTO_SCAN_EVERY_N=10` (or change it live in the settings modal) and the system continuously hunts for new identities while you work.

### What Phase 5 adds

- **`pru_math/hypothesizer.py`** — three detectors that scan `tool_outcomes` and verified attempts for patterns and propose structured hypotheses with deterministic fingerprints (so re-scans merge evidence into existing rows rather than duplicating):
  - `detect_specializations` — when one tool dominates a `problem_type` (verify rate ≥ 70%, n ≥ 3), propose "for this type, prefer that tool"
  - `detect_recurring_approaches` — when one approach dominates a signature class (verify rate ≥ 80%, n ≥ 3), propose "for this signature, prefer this approach"
  - `detect_identities` — group verified `SIMPLIFY/EXPAND/FACTOR` results by canonical form; pairs of distinct inputs that canonicalise to the same thing become candidate identities `lhs ≡ rhs`
- **Verification pipeline** — for identities: SymPy `simplify(lhs - rhs) == 0` first, numeric sampling next, Z3 `unsat`-on-negation when the subset allows; for stat-style hypotheses: re-check the threshold against the live store. Each verifier records its method (`sympy` / `numeric` / `z3` / `stat`) and a one-line detail.
- **Graph integration** — verified identities materialise as `rule` nodes (`r:hyp_<id>`) with `uses_rule` edges back to every supporting problem. They show up alongside everything else on the Graph tab.
- **New endpoints**: `GET /hypotheses?status=&kind=`, `GET /hypotheses/{id}`, `POST /hypotheses/scan?verify=true`, `POST /hypotheses/{id}/verify`. `GET /db/stats` now includes a `hypotheses: {status: count}` map.
- **Hypotheses tab** in the UI — list cards filtered by status / kind, scan-now button, re-verify per row, expandable raw evidence. The tab gains a count badge in the topbar.
- **Schema**: a new `hypotheses` table with `status`, `kind`, `claim`, `claim_repr`, `fingerprint` (UNIQUE), `evidence_json`, `method`, `verification_detail`, `rule_node`, and timestamps. Indexes on `status` and `kind`. Auto-created on existing databases.

## Running it

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

# CLI smoke test (no server needed)
python -m pru_math "Eq(x**2 - 5*x + 6, 0)"
python -m pru_math "Integral(x**2, (x, 0, 1))"
python -m pru_math "sin(x)^2 + cos(x)^2"

# Web UI
uvicorn pru_math.api:app --reload
# open http://localhost:8000
```

Optional: copy `.env.example` to `.env` to point at a different SQLite file,
a different Ollama host, or disable Ollama.

### Ollama (natural-language input)

The natural-language path shells out to a local Ollama server. If Ollama is
not running or `OLLAMA_ENABLED=false`, the parser silently skips that path —
SymPy syntax and LaTeX still work. The LLM never decides math; it only
translates language into a SymPy-parseable expression. See
`pru_math/parser.py` for the exact prompt.

ordering, cross-verifier picking), the **numeric tool** (fsolve/brentq
roots, scipy.quad, evalf), the **Z3 tool** (translator subset,
real/integer SOLVE, cross-verify agree/disagree on substituted roots,
graceful fail on transcendental input), the **Wolfram tool** (gated by
`WOLFRAM_APP_ID`, mock-based smoke), **cross-verification persistence**
(decision step lists multiple tools, cross-verify trace step exists when
enabled, `cross_verify_status` written to the attempt row, skipped cleanly
when no second tool can handle the problem), the **hypothesizer**
(Pythagorean identity discovery from raw inputs alone, verifier proves
correct pairs and refutes wrong ones, specialisation /
recurring-approach detection on synthetic stats, scan idempotency,
verified identities materialise rule nodes in the graph), the
**hypotheses API** (scan, status filter, get one, re-verify, 404), and
the FastAPI layer via `TestClient` (`/solve`, `/problems/{id}/similar`,
`/graph`, `/graph/around/{id}`, `/graph/stats`, `/attempts`,
`/tool_outcomes`, `/db/stats`, `/hypotheses`).

The NL parser is exercised via a mock so the suite doesn't need a running
Ollama. Z3 tests skip cleanly when `z3-solver` is not installed.

## What this system is NOT

- Not a replacement for SymPy or Mathematica. It **uses** them.
- Not a math LLM. The LLM is used only for parsing natural-language input and (in later phases) generating explanations of reasoning traces. It never decides math.
- Not a black box. Every decision is auditable by design. If it isn't, that's a bug.
